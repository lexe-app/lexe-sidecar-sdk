# Replit Configuration Files

This directory contains a pre-configured `process-compose.yaml` file for running the Lexe sidecar on Replit.

The configuration uses [process-compose](https://github.com/F1bonacc1/process-compose), a simple process orchestrator that manages the sidecar as a background daemon with automatic restart, health checks, and log rotation.

For complete setup instructions, see the **Replit Users** section in the [Lexe Sidecar SDK documentation](https://docs.lexe.app/sidecar-sdk/quickstart#replit-users).
